## Feature Usage Tracking

The enhanced generator includes feature usage statistics to track which new features are being utilized:

```python
self.feature_usage_stats = defaultdict(int)

# Track usage
for feature in ['vulnerabilities', 'threats', 'behavioral', 'entropy', 
               'signatures', 'hex_dump', 'symbols', 'disassembly', 
               'control_flow', 'code_quality', 'dependencies', 'yara_indicators']:
    if feature in analysis and analysis[feature]:
        self.feature_usage_stats[feature] += 1
```

This generates a report showing:
- Which features are most commonly available
- Usage percentages across all examples
- Opportunities for further enhancement
